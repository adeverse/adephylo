\title{The adephylo package}
\description{
This package is devoted to exploratory analysis of phylogenetic comparative
data. It re-implements and extends phylogenetic procedures from the
\code{ade4} package (which are now deprecated).\cr
}
\details{
Comparative data (phylogeny+traits) are handled as \code{\link[phylobase]{phylo4d-class}}
objects, a canonical class implemented by the \code{phylobase} package.
Trees are handled as \code{\link[ape:read.tree]{phylo}} objects (from the
\code{ape} package) or as \code{\link[phylobase]{phylo4-class}} objects (\code{phylobase}'s
extension of \code{phylo} objects).\cr

Main functionalities of \code{adephylo} are summarized below.\cr

=== TOPOLOGICAL INFORMATION ===\cr Several functions allow one to retrieve
topological information from a tree; such information can be used, for
instance, as a basis to compute distances or proximities between tips.\cr

- \code{\link{listDD}}: lists the direct descendants from each node of a
tree.\cr

- \code{\link{listTips}}: lists the tips descending from each node of a
tree.\cr

- \code{\link{.tipToRoot}}: finds the set of nodes between a tip and the
root of a tree.\cr

- \code{\link{sp.tips}}: finds the shortest path between tips of a tree.\cr

- \code{\link{treePart}}: defines partitions of tips reflecting the topology
of a tree. This function can output non-independent dummy vectors, or
alternatively an orthonormal basis used by the orthogram procedure.\cr

=== PHYLOGENETIC PROXIMITIES/DISTANCES ===\cr Several phylogenetic
proximities and distances are implemented. Auxiliary function easing the
computation of other distances/proximities are also provided:\cr

- \code{\link{distRoot}}: computes different distances of a set of tips to
the root.\cr

- \code{\link{distTips}}: computes different pairwise distances in a set of
tips.\cr

- \code{\link{proxTips}}: computes different proximities between a set of
tips.\cr

=== MEASURES/TESTS OF PHYLOGENETIC AUTOCORRELATION ===\cr Several procedures
allow one to measure, and/or test phylogenetic signal in biological
traits:\cr

- \code{\link{abouheif.moran}}: performs Abouheif's test, designed to detect
phylogenetic autocorrelation in a quantitative trait. This implementation is
not based on original heuristic procedure, but on the exact formulation
proposed by Pavoine et al. (2008), showing that the test is in fact a
Moran's index test. This implementation further extends the procedure by
allowing any measure of phylogenetic proximity (5 are proposed).\cr

- \code{\link{orthogram}}: performs the orthonormal decomposition of
variance of a quantitative variable on an orthonormal basis as in Ollier et
al. (2005). It also returns the results of five non parametric tests
associated to the variance decomposition.\cr

- \code{\link{moran.idx}}: computes Moran's index of autocorrelation given a
variable and a matrix of proximities among observations (no test).\cr

=== MODELLING/INVESTIGATION OF PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL ===\cr Rather than
testing or measuring phylogenetic autocorrelation, these procedures can be
used for further investigation of phylogenetic signal. Some, like
\code{\link{me.phylo}}, can be used to remove phylogenetic autocorrelation.
Others can be used to understand the nature of this autocorrelation (i.e.,
to ascertain which traits and tips are concerned by phylogenetic
non-independence).\cr

- \code{\link{me.phylo}}/\code{\link{orthobasis.phylo}}: these synonymous
functions compute Moran's eigenvectors (ME) associated to a tree. These
vectors model different observable phylogenetic signals. They can be used as
covariables to remove phylogenetic autocorrelation from data.\cr

- \code{\link{orthogram}}: the orthogram mentioned above also provides a
description of how biological variability is structured on a phylogeny.\cr

- \code{\link{ppca}}: performs a phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis
(pPCA, Jombart et al. 2010). This multivariate method investigates
phylogenetic patterns in a set of quantitative traits.\cr

=== GRAPHICS ===\cr Some plotting functions are proposed, most of them being
devoted to representing phylogeny and a quantitative information at the same
time.\cr

- \code{\link{table.phylo4d}}: fairly customisable way of representing
traits onto the tips of a phylogeny. Several traits can be plotted in a
single graphic.\cr

- \code{\link{bullseye}}: an alternative to \code{\link{table.phylo4d}}
based on fan-like representation, better for large trees.\cr

- \code{\link{scatter.ppca}}, \code{\link{screeplot.ppca}},
\code{\link{plot.ppca}}: several plots associated to a phylogenetic
principal component analysis (see \code{\link{ppca}}).\cr

=== DATASETS ===\cr Several datasets are also proposed. Some of these
datasets replace former version from \code{ade4}, which are now deprecated.
Here is a list of available datasets: \code{\link{carni19}},
\code{\link{carni70}}, \code{\link{lizards}}, \code{\link{maples}},
\code{\link{mjrochet}}, \code{\link{palm}}, \code{\link{procella}},
\code{\link{tithonia}}, and \code{\link{ungulates}}.\cr
