			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-15

FIXES

	o Update authors, description of tha spackage and add references
	o remove dontrun as required by CRAN
	
	
	        CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-7

FIXES

	o sp.tips now returns ordered paths between tips

FRESH BLOOD

	o Anders Ellern Bilgrau has joined the development team!




			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-5

FIXES

	o the new NAMESPACE selectively imports procedures to avoid
	conflicts between ape, phylobase, and ade4. Thes packages are no
	longer attached when loading adephylo

	o most dataset examples have been 'dontrun-ed' to save time during
	checks of the package on CRAN




			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-4


NEW FEATURES

	o added the function bullseye to plot fan-like phylogenies and
	associated traits.

	o added new methods for dibas.



			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-3


NEW FEATURES

	o added dibas, a new (and still under development) method for
	describing/testing phylogenetic clusters


BUG FIXES

	o replaced the use of .First.lib and library.dynam by more
	up-to-date procedures

	o replaced a call to a C procedure from ade4 to the same procedure
	in adephylo

	o replaced instances of 'printf' by 'Rprintf' in C procedures



			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-1


BUG FIXES

	o fixed the citation to be used for adephylo.



			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.1-0


NEW FEATURES

	o the phylogenetic Principal Component Analysis (pPCA, Jombart et
	al. 2010) has been implemented in adephylo. See ?ppca for more
	information.

	o phylogenetic distances and proximities are now computed using
	compiled C code, speeding up dramatically computations and making
	the functions applicable to large trees (thousands of tips).

	o table.phylo4d has now a color mode which allows using colors to
	represent values of traits; this is usefull for large trees.



			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.0-2


BUG FIXES

	o standardization of variables in abouheif.moran is now performed using 
	uniform weights (instead of marginal phylogenetic weights) 


	
			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.0-1


NEW FEATURES

	o first release on CRAN, first stable version

	o compatible with the first stable release of the phylobase package

	

			CHANGES IN ADEPHYLO VERSION 1.0-0


NEW FEATURES

	o first release of the package with unstable status. Compatible
	with phylobase (in	development) and ape packages; package
	only released on R-Forge, not CRAN.

	o re-implements all phylogenetic methods and datasets available in ade4

	o add new features to compute phylogenetic distances/proximities,
	pPCA, tree walks, ...
